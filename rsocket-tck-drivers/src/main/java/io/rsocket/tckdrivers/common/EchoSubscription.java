/**
 * This class is a special subscription that allows us to implement echo tests without having to use
 * ay complex complex Rx constructs. Subscriptions handle the sending of data to whoever is
 * requesting it, this subscription has a very basic implementation of a backpressurebuffer that
 * allows for flow control, and allows that the rate at which elements are produced to it can differ
 * from the rate at which they are consumed.
 *
 * <p>This class should be passed inside of MySubscriber when one wants to do an echo test, so that
 * all the values that the MySubscriber receives immediately gets buffered here and prepared to be
 * sent. This implementation is needed because we want to send both the exact same data and
 * metadata. If we used our ParseMarble class, we could append a function to allow dynamic changing
 * of our argMap object, but even then, there are only small finite number of characters we can use
 * in the marble diagram.
